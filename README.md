Hello!  
Welcome to the Alexander's IBM Data Science Course Repository.  
This repository aims to share several assignments and projects during the journey of learning and exploration on the IBM Data Science Professional Certification period  

There are several knowledges and applications that ive learnt during this professional course : 
1. **What is Data Science**, an introduction to the general concept of data science in the digital era, to transform the data to an insight.
2. **Tools in Data Science**, an explanation about tools and frameworks that data scientist uses to work with the data
3. **Data Science Methodology**, a comprehensive explanation to the data science work cycle, for every stage and phase of data scientist processes
4. **Python for Data Science, AI and Development**, an introduction and explanation about each Python Object, like list, tuple, dataframe, arithmatic operation, iteration, function, classess, atc
5. **Python Project for Data Science**, an implementation of the learning on a project based on Python
6. **Databases and SQL for Data Science**, an introduction to SQL language that use for query the data for the exploration
7. **Data Analysis with Python**, an overview and explanation to a brief data collection, data wrangling n manipulation, data visualization, and model development using Python
8. **Data Visualization with Python**, a comprehensive explanation about each type of visualization chart, and when is the condition that it is going to be used
9. **Machine Learning with Python**, a comprehensive explanation about each type of Machine Learning algorithm with its each advantages and disadvantages
10. **Applied Data Science Capstone**, a real-world case project that involves all the learnt material, from the data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, hypertune the best accuracy models, and model evaluation
